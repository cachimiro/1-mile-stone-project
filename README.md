Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
My website is based in a company that my friend in Colombia south America has started. The website has information on what the company does, how it does it and the products it makes. It also involves pictures of the products they make. Due to me being bilingual, I have made the site to have with a English and Spanish version.
Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
UX
I managed to create and develop this website, because I had the help from the owner of the company that the website was directed to, she told me how she wanted it and what she wanted. So, it was all trial and error until we found the right style that will suit her.
This website is designed to give an in site about what the company does and what it makes to the general public. in this project that my friend is preforming. Where she helps the people from the poorest Ares of Cartagena develop skills that will give them a better future. Removing them from gangs.
This website shows the handicrafts this people makes and the basic about the CEO, contact form and progression bars using a bit of JavaScript to animate the page, by doing so, it gives the costumers an overview of how well the company is doing, how are staff treated and the positive reviews it has. This creates a  connection with the costumer, as it gives information to the costumer that otherwise will not be the case. Making a connection with every one that comes to the website.
I achieved this by providing a user-friendly experience with the basic information, animated pictures, a bit of javaScript to animate some progression bars. When the customer is researching and reading in this company they can experience; slow motion moving images, information that’s straight to the point, which will keep the costumers engaged while they learn about the company. 
Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Existing Features
•	CEO button allows the user to get an InSite about the company: what it does, the sponsors it has and the contact information.
•	Contact button allows the user to request any information or questions they would like an answer for, if they decide that they don’t want to call.
•	Products button allows the user to see the products that the company makes.
•	Info button allows the user to see how well the company is doing.
In the future. The website will be developed to not only have information about the company. But make it will allow for the user to purchased products, and have automated emails, so that the company can get feedback from every purchase that is made.
Features Left to Implement
•	Code so that the email can do what is meant to do, by using JavaScript to achieve  this. 
Technologies Used
HTML, provided the basic structure for my website
 CSS, gave the style I needed and allowed me to move items across the web page 
 BOOTSTRAP, gave mw the basic framework to make the website look good 
 FONT AWESOME, gave the Icons to make it better user-friendly experience  
 HOVER CSS, that allowed the icons from Font Awesome to move, so that page could be animated 
JavaScript, to animate the progression bars.
Testing
1.	I have tested this website not only with mentor, but I have opened in my mobile phone and on all the screen sizes I have available, so that I could get an idea of what it will look like in different screen sizes, plus I have used the google chrome developer tools to test for screen size. After the web site was done, I made sure that every button, every picture did what it was meant to do. Also I got some friends to have a look around and tell me what was not working to help and minimise the risk of having an error. 
2.	In the prosses of testing I got several friends to a look at the website, I got the mentor to have a look at the website, also  my self testes all the links, all the pictures to make sure they did what they had to do.
i.	Go to the "Contact “ you will see that it will not let you submit unless you fill the fields that are required.
ii.	If you try to submit the form without filling the information required, an error message will come up, saying that you have to fill this section.
iii.	Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears.
As the screen gets smaller than 450px all border radius goes away, by doing so it makes the website look clean and fill all empty spaces. Also, the buttons that take you to different parts of the website change to a light grey colour. As for the hover function does not work for small devises that have touch screen.
One of the bugs is that the info “button when id put in an iPad screen view the footer comes up it does not stay at the bottom of the page. I tried using different setting, but I still could not get it to work. Also, when you are testing the responsive in smaller devises, depending on the computer you must refresh the page more than once to make sure it works. But this only happens in certain computers.
Deployment
This site is hosted in GitHub , deployed straight away from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order to host via GitHub, code should be pushed to gh-pages branch. Also, for the site to deploy correctly, it must be done on GitHub pages and the main page must be named: index.html. If you want to run this code locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting into your terminal the following link https://github.com/cachimiro/1-mile-stone-project. This will take you directly to the code.
